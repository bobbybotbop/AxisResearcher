You are an expert eBay SEO copywriter. The following title is too long for eBay's 80 character limit. Shorten it to strictly 73-77 characters while keeping the most important keywords and search terms.

Current title ({current_length} characters):
{current_title}

Characters to trim: {chars_over}

Rules:
1. Output must be strictly 73-77 characters (verify with character count)
2. Keep the primary product type and core keywords
3. Remove less important modifiers, redundant synonyms, or filler words first
4. Do NOT add new words that weren't in the original title
5. Do NOT use ALL CAPS, emojis, or quotes
6. Front-load the most important keywords

Respond with ONLY the shortened title, nothing else.

PROFESSIONAL PRODUCT PHOTOGRAPHY TRANSFORMATION SPECIFICATIONS
Format & Composition:

Aspect ratio: Square (1:1)
Primary focus: Main product should dominate the frame, taking up most of the image
Zoom in on the main product for clear visibility and detail
Framing: Tight composition with minimal whitespace, leaving only necessary margins for clean presentation
Simplification: Eliminate secondary/background objects that distract from the main product
Center the main subject within the frame
Perspective: Correct all lens and camera distortion; straighten lines and edges
Camera angle: Adjust viewpoint by approximately 10 degrees for improved presentation

Object Handling:

Identify and isolate the main product and any supporting objects from the background
Object recognition: Identical objects with similar shading but different scales should be treated as the same object (sizes may not be accurately proportioned in source)
Scale normalization: Rescale duplicate/identical objects to consistent, uniform sizes when necessary
Prioritize the main product—remove distracting secondary objects to enhance focus
Mandatory reorientation for retained objects:

Transform diagonal placements → vertical or horizontal orientations
Realign all objects to optimal viewing angles
Rotate and reposition each object for structured, intentional composition
Maintain proper scale and proportions during reorientation (after normalization)



Background:

Pure white studio backdrop (seamless infinity background)
Eliminate visible horizon line
Clean edge separation between product and background
Preserve natural drop shadows beneath objects for grounding and depth

Lighting Optimization:

Primary: Soft, diffused overhead lighting with even distribution
Secondary: Natural sunlight beams directed onto products
Balance overall illumination across the entire product
Eliminate harsh shadows and reduce hotspots
Adjust exposure for optimal brightness without overexposure
Create subtle tonal variations to enhance depth and dimensionality

Image Quality Enhancement:

Sharpen details and enhance definition
Reduce noise and grain
Optimize contrast for clarity
Accurate color reproduction
Do not fabricate or hallucinate product details—preserve original features as they appear

Content Cleanup:

Remove text and labels from the product and surrounding area
Preserve all brand logos and branding elements that are part of the product design

Product Integrity (Critical):

Maintain the complete physical structure and form of the product
Do NOT add, remove, or modify any parts, features, openings, or design elements of the actual product itself
Work only with existing details—avoid making up or inventing new product features

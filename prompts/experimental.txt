Create a new product photo showing the exact same product from a different angle optimized for eBay listings:
What to change:

Camera angle: 45-degree angle from front-right corner (shows depth and multiple sides)
Product positioning: Positioned at slight diagonal to camera for dimensional view
Distance/framing: Medium-close crop with small margin around product edges
Slight downward camera tilt for natural browsing perspective

What to preserve:

The EXACT same product with identical design, colors, materials, and features
Clean, well-lit studio lighting with soft shadows for professional appearance
Plain white or light neutral background (eBay standard)
All existing product details, textures, logos, and branding unchanged
DO NOT add any props, objects, lifestyle elements, or decorative items
DO NOT modify the product's design, add features, or remove components
Maintain sharp focus on all visible product surfaces

Goal: Generate a professional eBay-style product photo from a different angle that shows product dimension and detail—as if photographed again for a multi-angle listing. The image should look trustworthy, clear, and encourage buyer confidence.

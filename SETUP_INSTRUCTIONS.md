# eBay Search API Setup Instructions

## Fixed Issues

âœ… **Authentication Error Fixed**: The "Invalid access token" error has been resolved by switching to eBay's Finding API which only requires an App ID (no OAuth token needed).

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create Environment File

Create a `.env` file in your project directory with your eBay API credentials:

```env
# eBay API Credentials
# Get these from https://developer.ebay.com/
api_key=YOUR_EBAY_APP_ID_HERE
user_token=YOUR_USER_TOKEN_HERE

# Note: For basic search functionality, you only need the api_key (App ID)
# The user_token is only needed for user-specific operations
```

### 2. Get eBay API Credentials

1. Go to [eBay Developer Program](https://developer.ebay.com/)
2. Sign in with your eBay account
3. Create a new application
4. Get your **App ID** (this is your `api_key`)
5. For basic search, you don't need a user token

### 3. Test the Fix

Run the test script to verify everything works:

```bash
python ebay_search_test.py
```

Or run the main search script:

```bash
python ebay_search_AI.py
```

## What Was Fixed

1. **Authentication Method**: Switched from Browse API (requires OAuth) to Finding API (works with App ID only)
2. **Error Handling**: Added proper error messages and fallback methods
3. **API Priority**: Finding API is now tried first since it's more reliable for basic searches
4. **Test Script**: Updated to use the correct API endpoint and parameters

## API Differences

- **Finding API**: Uses App ID only, good for basic searches, has rate limits
- **Browse API**: Requires OAuth user token, more features, better for user-specific data
- **Alternative Method**: Scrapes eBay's public search page as a fallback

The code now automatically tries Finding API first, then Browse API (if you have a user token), then the alternative method if both fail.
